  "readme": "# gulp-remember [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/gulp-remember.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/gulp-remember) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ahaurw01/gulp-remember.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ahaurw01/gulp-remember)\n\n`gulp-remember` is a [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin that remembers files that have passed through it. `gulp-remember` adds all the files it has ever seen back into the stream.\n\n`gulp-remember` pairs nicely with [gulp-cached](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp-cached) when you want to only rebuild the files that changed, but still need to operate on all files in the set.\n\n```javascript\nvar remember = require('gulp-remember');\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis example shows a scenario in which you want to wrap all script files in some type of module system, then concatenate into one `app.js` file for consumption.\n\nAs long as your other plugins can keep up, this example showcases the Holy Grail of Build Toolsâ„¢ - the ability to build once, `git checkout different-branch` (a branch with drastically different files), and have the output be exactly what you would expect.\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n    header = require('gulp-header'),\n    footer = require('gulp-footer'),\n    concat = require('gulp-concat'),\n    cache = require('gulp-cached'),\n    remember = require('gulp-remember');\n\nvar scriptsGlob = 'src/**/*.js';\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function () {\n  return gulp.src(scriptsGlob)\n      .pipe(cache('scripts')) // only pass through changed files\n      .pipe(header('(function () {')) // do special things to the changed files...\n      .pipe(footer('})();')) // for example, add a stupid-simple module wrap to each file\n      .pipe(remember('scripts')) // add back all files to the stream\n      .pipe(concat('app.js')) // do things that require all files\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('public/'))\n});\n\ngulp.task('watch', function () {\n  var watcher = gulp.watch(scriptsGlob, ['scripts']); // watch the same files in our scripts task\n  watcher.on('change', function (event) {\n    if (event.type === 'deleted') { // if a file is deleted, forget about it\n      delete cache.caches['scripts'][event.path];\n      remember.forget('scripts', event.path);\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### remember(name)\n\nReturns a stream ready to remember files.\n\n#### name (optional)\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe name of a specific cache you want to use. You may want to `remember('javascripts')` in one area of your build while also being able to `remember('images')` in another.\n\nYou can choose not to pass any name if you only care about caching one set of files in your whole build.\n\n### remember.forget(name, path)\n\nDrops a file from a remember cache.\n\n#### name (optional)\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe name of the remember cache on which you want to operate. You do not need to pass this if you want to operate on the default remember cache.\n\n**Note:** If the name does not refer to a cache that exists, a warning is logged. Thanks to @jcppman for this.\n\n#### path (required)\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe path of the file you wish to drop from the remember cache. The path is used under the covers as the unique identifier for the file within one remember cache.\n\n**Important note!** The path you pass to `forget` must be the path of the *processed* file. You may encounter instances where your source file is `some/path/script.coffee` while the processed file is `some/path/script.js`. Because anything could happen before you `remember` a file, it is up to you to know how you need to `forget` it with the correct path.\n\nIf you want to `forget` files using their name history, you might want to use [gulp-remember-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-remember-history).\n\n**Another note:** If the path does not match a file object that exists in the given cache, a warning is logged. Thanks to @jcppman for this.\n\n### remember.forgetAll(name)\n\nDrops all files from a remember cache.\n\n#### name (optional)\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe name of the remember cache you want to wipe. You do not need to pass this if you want to operate on the default remember cache.\n\n**Note:** If the name does not refer to a cache that exists, a warning is logged.\n\n### remember.cacheFor(name)\n\nGet a raw remember cache. This can be useful for checking state of the cache, like whether or not a file has been seen before.\n\n**Note:** Remembering or forgetting files by interacting directly with this returned object is not recommended.\n\n#### name (optional)\n\nType: `String`\n\nThe name of the remember cache you want to retrieve. You do not need to pass this if you want to retrieve the default remember cache.\n\n## Gotchas\n\n### Forgetting files with altered paths\n\nSee the API note above for the `path` argument when `forget`ing files. `forget` can only drop files by their *processed* path name, not their *source* path name. In common cases, these two things are equivalent.\n\nThanks to @brian-mann for bringing this up.\n\n### File ordering\n\nBe aware that this plugin does not make specific attempts to keep your files in any order. For example, if you add a new file governed by a glob you are watching, this file will enter the stream last, even if this file would preceed others alphabetically.\n\nIf your build process depends on file ordering, please make use of the [gulp-order](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-order) plugin after `remember`ing files.\n\nThanks to @brian-mann for bringing this up.\n\n## License\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Aaron Haurwitz\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
